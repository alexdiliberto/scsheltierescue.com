      <h2 class="headline first">Surrendering a Sheltie to Rescue</h2>
      <p>If you currently own a Sheltie, work with, or know of a shelter that has a Sheltie and you need rescue for him/her, please call us at <a href="tel:+18039200644">803.920.0644</a>. If you get voicemail, please leave a brief message with a contact number and someone will be back in touch with you the same day.</p>
      <p>Since we work closely with the other Sheltie rescue in the state, Lowcountry/Charleston Sheltie Rescue, to provide safe haven for Shelties in need, we almost always have room for a new rescue. Both SC Sheltie Rescue and Lowcountry Sheltie Rescue are members of the ASSA (American Shetland Sheepdog Association) National Sheltie&nbsp;Rescue Network, which means we must meet certain requirements for the medical care of our rescues and for approving/screening new homes. We are always ready to provide a vet reference to anyone considering relinquishing their Sheltie(s) to us.**</p>
      <p>**If you are considering another rescue, PLEASE ask them for a vet reference. If they can&#39;t give you a vet to call who will verify that they are a good, responsible rescue, DON&#39;T give them your dog. For every good rescue out there, there are just as many bad ones. Anyone can respresent himself as a rescue person. It&#39;s up to you to check them out.</p>

      <h2 class="headline">What happens when you surrender your Sheltie?</h2>
      <p>After the Sheltie is placed in a foster home, the first thing we do is&nbsp;attend to the dog&#39;s medical needs: vaccinations, heartworm and fecal tests, spay/neuter, dental cleaning&nbsp;if needed, microchipping, and any other vet work&nbsp;indicated by the dog&#39;s age and condition&nbsp;(bloodwork, x-rays, surgery, etc.).</p>
      <p>We&nbsp;evaluate the dog&#39;s behavior, and then place them up for adoption. We&nbsp;accept adoption applications&nbsp;for the dog. If an application looks good, we&#39;ll conduct a vet check (which means we have to have a vet we can talk to who will verify that the adoption candidate is a responsible pet owner). If the vet check goes well, we then do a home visit and interview with the applicant.</p>
      <p>Once an applicant is approved to adopt, we allow them to meet any dogs we have who might be a good match for the applicant&#39;s home situation.</p>
      <p>If a good match is made, the applicant fills out and signs a legally binding contract and pays an adoption donation. Most people we adopt to opt to become part of our rescue group.</p>
