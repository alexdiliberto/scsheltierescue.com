          <h2 class="headline first">Surrendering a Sheltie to Rescue</h2>
          <p>If you currently own a sheltie or work with a shelter--or know of a shelter--that has a sheltie) and you need rescue for him/her, please call 803-920-0644. If you get voicemail, please leave a brief message with a contact number and someone will be back in touch with you the same day. </p>
          <p>Since we work closely with the other sheltie rescue in the state, Lowcountry/Charleston Sheltie Rescue, to provide safe haven for shelties in need, we almost always have room for a new rescue. Both SC Sheltie Rescue and Lowcountry Sheltie Rescue are members of the ASSA (American Shetland Sheepdog Association) national rescue network, which means we must meet certain requirements for the medical care of our rescues and for approving/screening new homes. We are always ready to provide a vet reference to anyone considering relinquishing their sheltie(s) to us.**</p>
          <p>**If you are considering another rescue, PLEASE ask them for a vet reference. If they can't give you a vet to call who will verify that they are a good, responsible rescue, DON'T give them your dog. For every good rescue out there, there are just as many bad ones. Anyone can respresent himself as a rescue person. It's up to you to check them out.</p>
          <h2 class="headline">What happens when you surrender your sheltie?</h2>
          <p>After the sheltie is placed in a foster home, the first thing we do is see to the dog's medical needs: vaccinations, heartworm and fecal tests, spay/neuter, dental if needed, microchipping, and any other vet work needed (bloodwork, x-rays, surgery, etc.).</p>
          <p>We start accepting adoption applications on the dog. If an application looks good, we'll conduct a vet check (which means we have to have a vet we can talk to who will verify that the adoption candidate is a responsible pet owner). If the vet check goes well, we then do a home visit and interview with the applicant.</p>
          <p>Once an applicant is approved to adopt, we allow them to meet any dogs we have who might be a good match for the applicant's home situation.</p>
          <p>If a good match is made, the applicant fills out and signs a legally binding contract and pays an adoption fee. Most people we adopt to opt to become part of our rescue group.</p>
